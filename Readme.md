# Reelo Coding Assignment

## About the Code

The data for our sample questions is stored in a data.json file and our script is ques_generator.js . In certain instances, the total number of questions available in this file may be less than the quantity required for a particular task. In such cases, to ensure we meet the required quota, questions will be systematically repeated. Furthermore, I have incorporated a feature that allows for topic-wise weightage, providing a more tailored and efficient approach to question selection.
